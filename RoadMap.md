# Chtholly Language Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for the Chtholly programming language.

## Phase 1: Core Compiler Infrastructure

- [x] Set up project structure (`src`, `tests`, `build.py`)
- [x] Implement command-line interface
- [x] Implement Lexer (Tokenization)
- [x] Implement Parser (AST Generation)
- [x] Implement AST Printer for debugging
- [x] Implement C++ Transpiler
- [x] Implement basic error reporting

## Phase 2: Language Features

- [x] Variables (let, mut) and basic types (int, double, bool, string)
- [ ] Arithmetic and logical operators
- [ ] Control flow (if/else, while, for)
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Arrays (static and dynamic)
- [ ] Classes (members, methods, constructors, destructors)
- [ ] Enums
- [ ] Modules and imports

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

- [ ] Generics (functions and classes)
- [ ] Type casting
- [ ] Standard library modules
- [ ] Advanced error handling
- [ ] Performance optimizations
