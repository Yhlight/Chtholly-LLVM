# Chtholly Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Chtholly programming language.

## Phase 1: Core Language Features

- [ ] Basic project structure (CMake, Python build script)
- [ ] Lexer implementation
- [ ] Parser for variable declarations and basic types
- [ ] AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) definition
- [ ] LLVM IR generation for basic assignments
- [ ] End-to-end "Hello, World!" compilation

## Phase 2: Intermediate Features

- [ ] Function definitions and calls
- [ ] Control flow (if/else, while loops)
- [ ] Ownership and borrowing system (move semantics)
- [ ] Structs and member access
- [ ] Basic standard library (iostream, math)

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

- [ ] Generics
- [ ] Traits and constraints
- [ ] Operator overloading
- [ ] Modules and imports
- [ ] Static reflection

## Phase 4: Self-Hosting and Optimization

- [ ] Self-hosting compiler
- [ ] Advanced LLVM optimizations
- [ ] Standard library expansion
